This document outlines the plan for creating a playable AI education game for the Vibe-athon.

IMPORTANT:
It all needs to be ONE html file

##  deliverables

### 1. Playable AI Education Game

Create a game, an open world game in the style of Stardew Valley, where your goal is to get across obstacles by using AI.

The game will teach you about how AI works and how best to use it, and how you will interact with the AI.

You will first get a quiz from those quizzes, if you answer correctly, you will get coins, which you can use as AI tokens.

You can then use these AI tokens with an item called a phone with a keyboard on it.

This item will allow you to interface with the AI, and the AI can change the game.

It can recode the game to add and remove things.

### 2. Icon

*   **Concept:** A brain with a graduation cap, symbolizing learning and AI.
*   **Style:** Simple, clean, and modern.
*   **Specifications:** 1:1 aspect ratio, preferably 1024x1024 pixels, PNG format.

### 3. Guide

*   **Format:** A short, in-game tutorial or a separate web page.
*   **Content:**
    *   How to play the game.
    *   Explanation of the basic AI concepts introduced in the game.
    *   Tips and tricks for training the AI effectively.

### 4. Soundtrack

*   **Style:** Lo-fi, ambient, and futuristic to create a "vibe".
*   **Generation:** We can use an AI music generation tool to create the soundtrack.

### 5. 4-Minute Presentation

*   **Structure:**
    1.  **Introduction (30s):** Hook the audience with a question about AI.
    2.  **The Problem (30s):** Explain why AI education is important and often inaccessible.
    3.  **Our Solution (1m):** Introduce the game and explain how it makes learning about AI fun and interactive.
    4.  **Demo (1m 30s):** A quick demonstration of the game's core mechanics.
    5.  **Conclusion (30s):** Summarize the project and its potential impact.

### 6. Demo

*   **Format:** A live demonstration during the presentation.
*   **Content:** Showcase a player starting a level, training the AI, and the AI successfully solving the puzzle.

### 7. AI Usage Explanation

*   **LLM-assisted Development:** Using Gemini to help with code generation, debugging, and documentation.
*   **Asset Generation:** Using AI tools to generate the game's icon, soundtrack, and potentially some in-game assets.
*   **In-Game AI:** The core of the game is the AI that players train. This will be a real, functioning AI model.
